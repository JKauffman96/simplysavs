                    <h2>The Start Of my Journey</h2>
                    <p>Recently I encountered neumourious health issues including these random sores (pictured).</p>
                    <p>These sores poped up everywhere on my face and the back of my neck. Sores that were close to or inside my hairline cause drastic hairloss</p>
                    <P>Dermitoligist were baffled as was any other doctor I saw. No one had answers for me</P>
                    <h2>My Solution</h2>
                    <p>With no direct answers I decided to do my own research.</p>
                    <p>Seeing the harmful chemiclas found in most store bought products lead me down a Holistic "rabbit hole"</p>
                    <p>I decided it was up to me to create a useful line of products that cut out the harmful chemicals and treated troubled skin conditions</p>
                    <p>These Before and After Pictures were taken 10 days apart after using only my Probiotic Face Oil, a best seller in a line of Holistic Products</p>
